title: "Provocations and Works-in-Progress"
---

The DIS 2019 Provocations and Works-in-Progress (PWiP) track is a format that allows authors to propose novel, in-progress, and thought provoking research that may emphasize different values than what are usually promoted. The PWiP format is intended to facilitate discussion between authors and conference attendees. We welcome all submissions related to the design of interactive systems as well as the conference theme of Contesting Borders and Intersections.

We particularly welcome design research contributions that value:

- Novelty over evidence (You do not need a finished user study!)
- Provocation over generalization (You do not need to make everyone happy!)
- Design making over design guidelines (Why not show us, rather than tell?)

While PWiP submissions need not have reached the level of completion of Full Paper submissions, they should demonstrate a contribution in terms of research and/or design knowledge. 

PWiP submissions must represent original content and cannot be currently under review elsewhere. We accept submissions that build upon prior work; however, the PWiP must offer a new, significant contribution over prior work.

All PWiP submissions will be peer-reviewed.

Accepted PWiP submissions will be published in the DIS 2019 companion publication and appear in the ACM Digital Library (adjunct proceedings). A PWiP publication is not an archival publication.

# Important Dates

- **Provocations & Works-in-Progress due:** Friday, 8 February 2019 (Submission closes at 5pm Pacific time)
- **Provocations & Works-in-Progress author notifications:** Thursday, 21 March 2019
- **Camera ready papers due:** Friday, 19 April 2019
- **DIS 2019 Conference, San Diego, USA:** 24-28 June 2019

# Preparing and Submitting

A PWiP paper should not exceed 4 pages (excluding references) formatted using the most recent SIGCHI Extended Abstracts Format (horizontal).

Please include one sentence that can be used in the conference program as a stand-alone teaser or provocation related to your submission, with the aim of drawing attendees to your presentation and engage in discussion.

All submissions should be anonymised and submitted via the Precision Conference System by 8 February, 2019.

# Presentation
Accepted PWiPs will be required to present a poster or similar physical visual/aural artefact as means of presenting your work and engaging conference attendees. We intend to do some innovation around the usual poster session format so we will work with authors of accepted PWiPs between the notification deadline and the conference itself to make this happen.
