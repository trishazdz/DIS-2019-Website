## Contesting Borders and Intersections

The ACM conference on Designing Interactive Systems is the premier international and interdisciplinary conference encompassing all issues related to the design and deployment of interactive systems where designers, artists, theorists, psychologists, user experience researchers, systems engineers and many more come together to debate and shape the future of interaction systems research, design, and practice.

The theme for ACM DIS2019 is "Contesting Borders and Intersections." Both borders and intersections are simultaneously about separation, margins, and friction as well as opportunities, promises, and imaginaries where alternative and diverse modes of engagements can be made possible and unfold. With this theme, we encourage submissions that critique, resist, and/or reimagine taken-for-granted boundaries in interactive design research and practices, as well as those that present innovative thinking, and creative or provocative interaction design.

We are excited to co-locate our conference with [Creativity and Cognition 2019](http://cc.acm.org/2019/). There will be some overlapping programs to strengthen the dialogues between our two related communities.
