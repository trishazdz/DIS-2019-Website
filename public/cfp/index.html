<p>The ACM conference on Designing Interactive Systems (DIS) is the premier, international, and interdisciplinary conference encompassing all issues related to the design and deployment of interactive systems where designers, artists, theorists, psychologists, user experience researchers, systems engineers and many more come together to debate and shape the future of interactive systems research, design, and practice.</p>

<h2 id="theme">THEME</h2>

<p>The theme for ACM DIS2019 is “Contesting Borders and Intersections.” Both borders and intersections are simultaneously about separation, margins, and friction as well as opportunities, promises, and imaginaries where alternative and diverse modes of engagements can be made possible and unfold.  With this theme, we encourage submissions that critique, resist, and/or reimagine taken-for-granted boundaries in interactive design research and practices.</p>

<p>Full papers published at DIS2019 are ACM archival publications and will be made available through the <a href="http://dl.acm.org" target="_blank">ACM in the Digital Library</a>.  Other submission categories at DIS2019 that will be included in the ACM Digital Library are Pictorials, Provocations/Work in Progress, Doctoral Consortium, Demos, and Workshop Proposals. All represent significant contributions to the field of HCI and interaction design. All of the DIS proceedings are in a public version of the Digital Library for one month starting on the first day of the conference and accessible for one year.</p>

<p>DIS 2019 will be held in San Diego, CA just forty miles north of the sometimes contested border between Mexico and the United States. Breaking down another border, DIS 2019 will be held jointly with the Creativity and Cognition (C&amp;C) 2019 conference. There will be some overlapping programs to strengthen the dialogues between these two related communities, however, authors must choose which conference to submit to — submissions will not be shared or moved between C&amp;C and DIS.</p>

<h2 id="papers">PAPERS</h2>

<p>DIS2019 includes the following four subcommittees for Paper submissions (please note that they are different from previous DIS conferences):</p>

<h3 id="critical-computing-and-design-theory">Critical Computing and Design Theory</h3>

<p>Critical computing and design theory have contributed to one another for decades. This subcommittee seeks papers that carry this work into a new generation&ndash;exploring the relationships among design inquiry, politics, aesthetics, ethics, and craftsmanship as well as unpacking the notion of criticality in design and computing.</p>

<h3 id="design-methods-and-processes">Design Methods and Processes</h3>

<p>Share your inventions and insights that open up new spaces for design, allow for engagement with new, difficult to access communities, and enable designers to play with exciting new materials. This subcommittee seeks papers that document, innovate and/or advance the methods and processes used by UX and service design practitioners; user researchers from industry, academia, and NGOs; and academic design researchers working in HCI and interaction design.</p>

<h3 id="experiences-artifacts-and-technology">Experiences, Artifacts, and Technology</h3>

<p>Interactions with digital artifacts and technologies are an inescapable facet of our everyday experience. This subcommittee seeks papers that explore new relationships and intersections amongst and between experiences, artifacts and technologies, and the ways in which meaningful and impactful interactions are designed, created and engendered.</p>

<h3 id="change-through-design">Change Through Design</h3>

<p>Design has the potential to enact positive change and/or tackle large-scale and complex societal, cultural, economic, environmental, and/or political challenges in the world. What are the political, ethical, and moral dimensions of design? Who is allowed to participate in design processes, and who are our designs for? This subcommittee seeks papers about design activism discourses, approaches, processes, tools, and inspirational cases/exemplars.</p>

<h2 id="pictorials">PICTORIALS</h2>

<p>As design perspectives have increasingly become integrated in HCI practice and research, new approaches are needed to communicate design practices, processes, products and artifacts to the HCI community. Pictorials may have a practical nature, a theoretical nature or both. Pictorials are papers in which the visual components (e.g. diagrams, sketches, illustrations, renderings, photographs, annotated photographs, collages) are the primary means of conveying information with at least, if not more, importance as the accompanying text.  Through DIS Pictorials, design practitioners in academia, industry, non-profits, or collectives are encouraged to express and unpack their design concepts, practices and projects in rich, heavily visual ways. This format helps foster discussions among authors, conference attendees, and the wider community through the sharing of methods, insights and lessons learned from engaging in the design of interactive systems and artifacts.</p>

<h2 id="provocations-and-works-in-progress">PROVOCATIONS and WORKS-IN-PROGRESS</h2>

<p>The DIS 2019 Provocations and Works-in-Progress (PWiP) track is a format that allows authors to propose novel, in-progress, and thought provoking research that may emphasize different values than what are usually promoted. The PWiP format is intended to facilitate discussion between authors and conference attendees. We welcome all submissions related to the design of interactive systems, particularly those design research contributions that value:</p>

<ul>
<li>Novelty over evidence (You do not need a finished user study!)</li>
<li>Provocation over generalization (You do not need to make everyone happy!)</li>
<li>Design making over design guidelines (Why not show us, rather than tell?)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="worskshops">WORSKSHOPS</h2>

<p>Workshops offer unique opportunities for diverse groups of scholars, practitioners, and researchers to spend focused time on generative topics. A workshop format is ideal for working together on open, unresolved or controversial issues and developing a diverse range of outputs. Well designed and facilitated workshops attract broad interdisciplinary interest, inspire interaction between participants and foster community-building. We encourage proposals to host a workshop that encourage participants to engage in alternatives to established approaches in design and computing; this can include but is not limited to artistic and humanistic approaches, craft, tinkering, hacking, feminist, postcolonial, and longer-term approaches to design, reflective engagements with politics and cultures of design.</p>

<p>Since DIS and C&amp;C will share the conference venue, workshops that would be of particular interest to attendees of C&amp;C as well as DIS, are encouraged. The Workshop Chairs of C&amp;C and DIS will share proposals to create an overall program of workshops that not only serve the particular needs and interest of their own communities but will look for opportunities to increase the dialogue between them, as well as try to minimize duplication.</p>
